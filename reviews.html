				<!-- OCT FIRST REVIEW -->
				<h3>October 1st</h3>
				<p><b><span id="purple">Movie:</span> Mr. Jones</b>

					<br /><br />

					<b><span id="purple">Rating:</span></b> I went back and forth a lot on whether I liked this one. I was entertained, but idk if I enjoyed it. So let's say like 3/5 stars.
					
					<br /><br />

					<b><span id="purple">Influences:</span></b>
					Mr. Jones has a few different influences (that I picked up on and/or projected), but mostly I got Blair Witch vibes. The movie is mostly the two leads filming themselves, Blair Witch style. I also detected hints of other stuff that I have since forgotten.
					
					<br /><br />


					<b><span id="purple">Characters:</span></b>
					As far as the two leads go, I hated them both. I'm gonna call them The Guy and The Gal. They are a hetero couple, having some Relationship Problems (it is unclear what they've been through). They've decided to go live in the woods for a year or something to "work on their relationship" and also...shoot a documentary? About...something? If you can't tell by those plot points, they were both really annoying. At least one of them was charging into the supernatural equivalent of oncoming traffic at all times.<br />
					Then there's the titular Mr. Jones. We...never learn much about him actually. Maybe he's an artist? Or a shaman? Or a figment of our imagination?<br />
					And then there are some experts:
					<ul>
						<li>An art dealer who got one of Mr. Jones' original pieces in the mail and then got rich and famous after displaying the piece in his gallery.</li>
						<li>A deeply upset man who also got an original work in the mail, but it drove him crazy instead of making his gallery really popular and profitable.</li>
						<li>Some other guys, too.</li>
					</ul>
					<b><span id="purple">Plot, Mistakes, and Hot Takes:</span></b> In the beginning, The Guy is making a documentary. In theory, I guess? Maybe he's planning to make one. He does some voice-over narration up front, so probably there's more exposition than I remember. I think at this point I was wondering if I put the right movie on because I thought I was watching a crazy neighbor movie.<br /><br />
					<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px;">(Also there's this whole thing where The Guy and The Gal are fighting and he admits to having stopped taking his "pills." No medical history or diagnosis is mentioned, so presumably we are to conclude mental illness? Of course, even though this medication subplot seems to trigger a lot of tension, it is immediately abandoned. It means something...but what? We will never know.Since relationship woes are mundane af, this self-help documentary quickly morphs into a documentary about wanting to make a documentary about a reclusive artist, Mr. Jones. At this point, it was clear I was watching the crazy neighbor movie I intended to watch. The Gal describes Mr. Jones as "like Banksy" at one point, I guess due to his renegade art distribution. It is this respect for his craft that leads The Gal to entirely disregard Mr. Jones' privacy.)</p><br />
					First, The Guy and The Gal find another house near (but also far?) from their own cabin. No one knew it was there. Mysterious and intriguing! The Guy is totally down to just walk through the whole house, check out the back yard and the shed, etc. So he does. The Gal, so far the reasonable one, keeps telling him they need to leave this place. The Guy just won't. He goes into a basement in the shed (read: "supernatural equivalent of oncoming traffic") and finds all these artisanal scarecrows/creepy statues/effigy-like things. A picture is worth a thousand words, so <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFhMjAwOWItMmJiYi00ZGQzLWJmYzEtNTVkYWEzNzFkYTMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwNDMwNzI@._V1_.jpg" target="_blank">here you go</a>. They run around in the basement filming and The Guy is scared shitless, but The Gal is having a great time. Hmm okay so maybe not the reasonable one. Oooooh, she's familiar with these creepy things because they're art, that's fiiine, then.<br /><br />
					So now The Gal is obsessed and stalking Mr. Jones' house and eventually actually meets him. She insists to The Guy that he is trying to keep her safe/help her. It's implied that this was true, although I don't know what that means for the scarecrow recipient The Guy interviewed. Clearly that man's life was wrecked.<br />
					That man mentions having a nightmare every time he sleeps where he is chasing himself and disaster will strike if he catches himself. Disaster in the form of evil hatching from his brain basically, like Athena from Zeus.<br /><br />
					Even though I'm making fun of recklessness of The Gal and Guy, this portion was entertaining for sure. I was really interested to know what these crazy kids would stumble onto next. I couldn't maintain any empathy for them because they weren't likable and seemed to have death wishes, but that didn't keep me from having a good time. The visuals were really interesting and I liked the folklore element with the experts interviews. It was a very aesthetically pleasing movie, too. I really enjoyed just taking it in.<br /><br />
					Of course, they don't really stay in documentary mode. Instead they Blair out, with front-facing camera on at all times. The Guy goes into the basement of Mr. Jones' house and then into a cave beneath. He jokes about getting lost and then gets lost. Going trespassing and then spelunking was so obviously a fantasticly bad idea, but presumably that's just quitter talk for The Guy. Idk I don't get it.<br />The Guy steals a figurine out of some sort of ceremonial arrangment in the caves because of course he does.<br /><br />
					Then we get into the Nightmare. I am a sucker for on-screen depictions of nightmares and dreams. Inland Empire and the Buffy season 4 penultimate episode Restless are my gold standards. Overall, I liked their take.<br />
					Basically, it turns out that stealing the figurine plunged the world into a Nightmare World. Lots of things are going wrong. Things are getting trippy and The Guy seems to be dipping into and out of reality. There's a lot of banging on the doors and The Gal and The Guy aren't super happy with that. It is dark well into the late morning and that simply won't do.<br /><br />
					The Guy has to take the figurine back and then put on Mr. Jones' mask, which was left behind. Mr. Jones doesn't exist anymore (???), so it's time for The Guy to take over.<br /><br />You're the Jones now, Guy.<br /><br />

				<!--OCT SECOND REVIEW -->
				<h3>October 2nd</h3>

				<p>

					<b><span id="purple">Movie:</span></b> The Perfect Host

					<br /><br />

					<b><span id="purple">Rating:</span></b> 3.5 out of 5 stars.

					<br /><br />

					<b><span id="purple">Characters:</span></b> There aren't too many characters. Our stars are Robber Guy and Niles Crane. Robber Guy robbed a bank shortly before our story begins because he's bad to the bone. The supporting cast is Simone P-something (her character name, I don't know the actress' name) and some cops. Simone is Robber Guy's girlfriend or something.
					<br /><br />
					<b><span id="purple">Plot, Mistakes, and Hot Takes:</span></b> I enjoyed this movie. Well, the plot was a mess, but I enjoyed David Hyde Pierce. I thought he was great...he truly was a perfect host. Before I even watched the movie, I wrote down this joke: "Maybe this is just Niles' way of saying he does a better villain than Frasier, and he even does it without playing second in command to a drunken clown or obsessively fixating on murdering Bart Simpson." Seriously, though, DHP plays a great villain. I think usually with an elegant villain, the villain's composure cracks. Maybe they seemed calm and in control, but it becomes clear this is not the case and they break and/or break things and/or scream, etc. It can be very hammy. It's hard not to be hammy when going from a shuffle to a sprint.
					<br />David Hyde Pierce does not crack.<br />
					This dude is actually quite self-aware. We will get back to that.
					<br /><br />
					Basically, the party DHP is hosting has only imaginary guests, besides Robber Guy. First it seems like Robber Guy is perhaps in charge (I mean, obviously it won't stay that way because the name of the movie is The Perfect Host, but let's suspend our disbelief), or going to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Robber Guy impersonates a friend of a friend to gain entry into DHP's home and evade the authorities, who aren't super pleased with him for robbing a bank. DHP tells him he's having a dinner party and Robber Guy lingers anyway, because too much crime spoils one's manners. Despite having plans and never having met this supposed friend of a friend, DHP is being legitimately helpful at first. He is ready to help this stranger find a hotel and stuff, but nooooo, of course Robber Guy has to be all "on the lam" and shit and making up excuses.<br /><br />
					DHP's character maintained his composure in a way that I found to be unusual. It's not an unusual trope, the whole "this guy is CRAZY and talking to fake people and maybe he seems calm now but CRAZY people are latently VIOLENT" thing. It's gross af, but common.<br />However DHP's host with the most is very aware of his illness. What illness? Idk, Hollywood Hysteria Syndrome. The kind of mental illness where a screenwriter just made something wild, but thankfully that wild thing is controllable with meds. What meds? Idk whatever pills people take when they're crazy. Just some good old fashioned mental health stigma.<br />
					Mr. Perfect Host's illness is that he has a posse, except that it's an imaginary one so he's regular sick and not siiiiiick, bruh. When Mr. Perfect Host takes his pills, the members of his posse shut up. I mean, they're still all hanging out, but they're not talking anymore. Which is at least a little better. As Mr. Perfect Host says, "I need to function at work."<br />
					And where does he work? Oh, he's a cop. Mr. Perfect Host is a policeman. He has a gun. He even says "liberal" disdainfully at one point.<br />Lieutenant Perfect Host is also investigating the bank robbery of Robber Guy. Thankfully, it turns out Lieutenant Perfect Host isn't really a killer! Robber Guy does not die, he just ends up passed out in an alley with a lot of wound make up on. So all Lieutenant Perfect Host was truly guilty of is drugging him and applying spirit gum, which certainly isn't NOTHING but isn't murder.<br /><br />That's right. Yes, really. All the wounds turn out to be stage makeup.<br /><br />
					<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px;">
					(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZtunFYus28" target="_blank">"And Martin's found an old trunk full of stage makeup in the basement and he's sending it along! We can always use more makeup!"</a>)
					</p>
					<br />
					So, in summary, Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA isn't a killer, just a cop who likes to drug people and hold them hostage (so he can practice his costume make up skills?). Throughout the hostage experience, his guest will be shown a fun little scrapbook. It's got polaroids of guests looking all beaten up and dead and also some violent doodles. It looks like something a hack art student would make ironically. But don't tell Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA I said that, I don't want to hurt his feelings.<br /><br />
					Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA is the best part of the movie and his work is pretty much entirely why it earned 3.5 stars. By plot merit, it did not deserve it. There was too much going on...there's the dinner party, but there's also the robbery, which Robber Guy's bae Simone was in on. She is both a bank teller and the master mind behind this heist. Simone also double crosses Robber Guy, which leads to a whole thing. Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA intercepts Robber Guy while his cop teammates are dealing with Simone. He lets Robber Guy escape with some cash so he doesn't tattle about the dinner party. Letting him go definitely doesn't backfire.<br />JK IT TOTALLY DOES.<br />Robber Guy managed to hold onto a Polaroid picture Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA took of the two of them together during their wacky evening. He mails it from Mexico to Other Cop. Other Cop calls Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA out over this. Naturally, Lieutenant Perfect Host: MUA responds by inviting Other Cop over for dinner. I hope Other Cop doesn't have sensitive skin because he's about to be covered in movie magic.<br /><br />Yeah, idk, I guess that's all the rambling I have for now. Review over!
